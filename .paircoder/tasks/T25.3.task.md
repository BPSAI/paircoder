# T25.3: Add architecture diagram

## Objective

Create an ASCII or Mermaid diagram showing the post-refactor CLI architecture.

## Context

After EPIC-003, the CLI has a clean modular structure:
```
cli.py (registration only)
  ├── commands/     → Core CLI commands
  ├── planning/     → plan, task commands
  ├── sprint/       → sprint commands
  ├── release/      → release, template commands
  ├── trello/       → Trello integration
  └── core/         → Shared infrastructure (config, hooks, ops, utils)
```

A visual diagram helps new developers understand the architecture.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create ASCII or Mermaid diagram of CLI architecture
- [ ] Show module relationships and dependencies
- [ ] Include in FEATURE_MATRIX.md or separate architecture doc
- [ ] Diagram is accurate and complete
- [ ] Easy to maintain (prefer ASCII or simple Mermaid)

## Files to Modify

- `.paircoder/docs/FEATURE_MATRIX.md` or new `docs/architecture.md`

## Dependencies

- T25.1 (FEATURE_MATRIX updated)
- T25.2 (Developer docs updated)

## Notes

Prefer ASCII art for maximum compatibility. Mermaid is acceptable if project already uses it elsewhere.
