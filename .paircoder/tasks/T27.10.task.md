# Objective

Sync all commands from main project to cookiecutter template (except /status).

# Implementation Plan

1. Copy all commands to template (except status.md)
2. Verify /status is NOT included (conflicts with Claude Code)
3. Review for any project-specific content

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All commands present (except `/status`)
- [ ] No `/status` command in template
- [ ] Commands match v2.8 versions

# Verification

```bash
# List commands in template
ls -la tools/cli/bpsai_pair/data/cookiecutter-paircoder/{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}/.claude/commands/
# Should NOT show status.md

# Compare with main (except status.md)
diff -r --exclude=status.md .claude/commands/ tools/cli/bpsai_pair/data/cookiecutter-paircoder/{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}/.claude/commands/
```
