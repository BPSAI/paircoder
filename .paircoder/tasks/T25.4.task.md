# T25.4: Remove deprecated code paths

## Objective

Clean up deprecated code, backward-compat shims, and TODO/FIXME comments added during the EPIC-003 refactor.

## Context

During the refactor, various temporary compatibility measures may have been added:
- Backward-compat import shims
- TODO/FIXME comments for deferred cleanup
- Dead code paths

Now that the refactor is complete, these should be removed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Remove any backward-compat shims from refactor
- [ ] Clean up TODO/FIXME comments added during refactor
- [ ] Remove dead code paths
- [ ] No unused imports remaining
- [ ] All tests still pass

## Files to Modify

- Various files touched during EPIC-003 refactor
- Search for patterns: `TODO`, `FIXME`, `DEPRECATED`, `# COMPAT`

## Dependencies

- T24.11-T24.13 (Parser consolidation)

## Notes

Search commands:
```bash
grep -rn "TODO\|FIXME" bpsai_pair/ --include="*.py"
grep -rn "DEPRECATED\|COMPAT" bpsai_pair/ --include="*.py"
```
