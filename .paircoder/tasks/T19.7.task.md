# Objective

Document Claude Code's built-in commands and how PairCoder integrates with them.

# Deliverable

Create `docs/CLAUDE_CODE_INTEGRATION.md` with:

- List of built-in commands we leverage
- Commands to avoid conflicting with
- How PairCoder commands complement built-ins
- Best practices for combined usage

## Key Commands to Document

| Command | Integration |
|---------|-------------|
| `/compact` | Use before large tasks; triggers state save |
| `/context` | Check token budget |
| `/plan` | Use built-in for session planning |
| `/sandbox` | Use for security-sensitive execution |
| `/todos` | Future: could sync with task system |

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `docs/CLAUDE_CODE_INTEGRATION.md` created
- [ ] Lists built-in commands relevant to PairCoder usage
- [ ] Documents PairCoder integration notes for relevant commands
- [ ] Includes best practices section
- [ ] Added reference in USER_GUIDE.md or main docs
- [ ] No duplicate content with existing docs

# Files to Modify

- `docs/CLAUDE_CODE_INTEGRATION.md` - New file
- `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` - Add reference
