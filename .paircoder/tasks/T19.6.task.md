# Objective

Consolidate `trello-task-workflow` into `paircoder-task-lifecycle`. The two skills have 80% overlap - merge into one with a Trello-specific section.

# Implementation

1. Add "Trello-Specific Commands" section to `paircoder-task-lifecycle`
2. Move unique content from `trello-task-workflow`
3. Delete `trello-task-workflow` skill
4. Keep `trello-aware-planning` separate (different purpose)
5. Update any references

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `paircoder-task-lifecycle` SKILL.md has Trello-specific section
- [ ] All unique content from trello-task-workflow is preserved
- [ ] `.claude/skills/trello-task-workflow/` directory deleted
- [ ] `trello-aware-planning` skill unchanged
- [ ] No broken references in CLAUDE.md or other docs
- [ ] Skill validates with T19.5 validator (if completed)

# Files to Modify

- `.claude/skills/paircoder-task-lifecycle/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/trello-task-workflow/` - Delete
- `CLAUDE.md` - Update references
- `.claude/settings.json` - Update if needed

# Dependencies

T19.5 (skill validator - to verify after merge, optional)
