# Objective

Document the release process to prevent future release issues and ensure consistency.

# Deliverables

## 1. `docs/RELEASING.md` - Step-by-step release guide

Contents:
- Version bump locations (now just pyproject.toml after T18.1)
- CHANGELOG format and conventions
- How to use `bpsai-pair release prep`
- Cookie cutter sync process (and `template check`)
- CI/CD pipeline overview
- Git tagging and GitHub release creation

## 2. Updated CONTRIBUTING.md

Add release section covering:
- Who can release
- Release cadence
- Pre-release checklist

## 3. PR Template Update

Add release checklist to `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`:

```markdown
## Release Checklist (for version bumps only)
- [ ] Version bumped in pyproject.toml
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated
- [ ] `bpsai-pair release prep` shows all green
- [ ] Cookie cutter template synced
```
## Release Checklist Item: Package Exports

Before release, verify `__init__.py` exports all public modules:
```bash
# Quick check - should list all feature modules
python -c "import bpsai_pair; print(bpsai_pair.__all__)"
```

New feature modules must be added to:
1. `tools/cli/bpsai_pair/__init__.py` - Import and `__all__`
2. This checklist
