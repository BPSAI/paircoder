# T24.12: Deprecate v1 flow format (keep reader for migration)

## Objective

Add deprecation warnings for v1 flow format while keeping v1 reader code for migration purposes.

## Context

After merging the parsers in T24.11, we need to establish v2 as the canonical format while providing a migration path for any v1 flows.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add deprecation warnings when v1 flow format is detected
- [ ] Keep v1 reader code for migration purposes
- [ ] Document v1 → v2 migration path if formats differ
- [ ] Warnings include clear migration instructions
- [ ] Tests cover deprecation warning behavior

## Files to Modify

- `bpsai_pair/flows/parser.py` - Add deprecation logic

## Dependencies

- T24.11: Merge flows/parser.py + parser_v2.py (must complete first)

## Notes

Use Python's `warnings` module with `DeprecationWarning` category. Include helpful message about how to migrate to v2 format.
