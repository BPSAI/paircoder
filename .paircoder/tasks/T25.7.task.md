# T25.7: Add tiktoken dependency

## Objective

Add tiktoken as a dependency for accurate token counting in the token budget system.

## Context

Token budget system requires accurate token estimation. tiktoken is OpenAI's fast BPE tokenizer that supports Claude-compatible tokenization.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add `tiktoken = "^0.5.0"` to pyproject.toml dependencies
- [ ] Run `poetry lock` to update lock file
- [ ] Verify import works: `python -c "import tiktoken"`
- [ ] Document tiktoken usage in code comments

## Files to Modify

- `pyproject.toml` - Add tiktoken dependency

## Dependencies

None - foundation for T25.8.

## Notes

tiktoken uses `cl100k_base` encoding which is compatible with Claude models. The package is well-maintained by OpenAI and commonly used for token estimation.
