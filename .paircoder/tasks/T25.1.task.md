# T25.1: Update FEATURE_MATRIX.md with new structure

## Objective

Update the FEATURE_MATRIX.md document to reflect the new module structure after EPIC-003 refactoring.

## Context

EPIC-003 has restructured the CLI codebase significantly:
- Created `core/` module for shared infrastructure
- Created `commands/`, `sprint/`, `release/` modules
- Consolidated parsers
- Moved files from root level

The documentation needs to reflect these changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Update module/file structure in FEATURE_MATRIX.md
- [ ] Reflect new `core/`, `commands/`, `sprint/`, `release/` structure
- [ ] Update line counts if changed significantly
- [ ] Update any affected diagrams or tables
- [ ] Document consolidated parser location

## Files to Modify

- `.paircoder/docs/FEATURE_MATRIX.md`

## Dependencies

- T24.11-T24.13 (Parser consolidation complete)
- T25.4 (Deprecated code removed)

## Notes

Focus on accuracy over detail - ensure developers can quickly understand the new architecture.
