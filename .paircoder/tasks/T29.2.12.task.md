# Audit Findings

## Documentation Inaccuracies Found

### DOC-001: Command Count Claim (HIGH)

**Location:** CLAUDE.md (line 3), README.md (line 3), FEATURE_MATRIX.md
**Claim:** "127+ commands"
**Actual:** 182 commands (44 top-level + 138 subcommands)
**Impact:** Significantly understates CLI capabilities

### DOC-002: Skills Count (MEDIUM)

**Location:** CLAUDE.md (line 59)

2. implementing-with-tdd
3. reviewing-code
4. finishing-branches
5. managing-task-lifecycle
6. planning-with-trello
7. creating-skills
8. releasing-versions

### DOC-003: Trello Check/Uncheck Attribution (MEDIUM)

**Location:** FEATURE_MATRIX.md (line 144)
**Claim:** `trello check/uncheck`
**Actual:** Commands are `ttask check` and `ttask uncheck`
**Impact:** Users can't find these commands under `trello`

### DOC-004: MCP Tools Count (MEDIUM)

**Location:** FEATURE_MATRIX.md
**Claim:** 13 MCP tools
**Actual:** 15 MCP tools (missing `orchestrate_plan` and `orchestrate_review`)
