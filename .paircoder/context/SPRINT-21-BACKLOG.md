## Backlog Items

### T21.1: /update-skills Slash Command

**Priority:** P1
**Effort:** M (4 hrs)
**Type:** feature
**Source:** TASK-131 (from original roadmap)

#### Description

Create a slash command that analyzes recent conversation patterns and suggests skill updates or new skills.

#### Implementation

```markdown
# .claude/commands/update-skills.md
---
description: Analyze recent conversations and suggest skill improvements
allowed-tools: Bash(bpsai-pair skill:*)
---

Analyze the current conversation for:
1. Repeated workflows not captured in existing skills
2. Commands or patterns used frequently
3. Gaps where a skill would have helped

Then:
1. Run `bpsai-pair skill suggest` to get AI recommendations
2. Present suggestions to user
3. If approved, create skill draft with `bpsai-pair skill create`
```

#### CLI Support

```bash
# Analyze conversation for skill opportunities
bpsai-pair skill suggest

Analyzing recent patterns...

Suggested Skills:
1. "debugging-python-tests" (confidence: 85%)
   - Pattern: pytest failures → read traceback → fix → rerun
   - Would save: ~5 min per debug cycle

2. "reviewing-pull-requests" (confidence: 72%)
   - Pattern: checkout PR → review files → add comments
   - Note: Overlaps with existing code-review skill

Create skill draft? [1/2/skip]:
```

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `/update-skills` command exists
- [ ] Analyzes conversation for patterns
- [ ] Suggests new skills with confidence scores
- [ ] Can create skill drafts from suggestions
- [ ] Integrates with skill validator

---

### T21.2: Skill Gap Detection

**Priority:** P1
**Effort:** L (6 hrs)
**Type:** feature

#### Description

Detect when user needs a skill that doesn't exist. Monitor for repeated manual workflows and suggest skill creation.

#### Detection Signals

1. **Repeated commands:** Same sequence of commands run multiple times
2. **Repeated questions:** User asks similar clarifying questions
3. **Manual workarounds:** User describes process that could be automated
4. **Error patterns:** Same type of error handled the same way

#### Implementation

```python
class SkillGapDetector:
    def analyze_session(self, session_log: List[Message]) -> List[SkillGap]:
        """Detect potential skill gaps from session."""
        patterns = self.extract_patterns(session_log)
        gaps = []
        for pattern in patterns:
            if pattern.frequency >= 3 and not self.has_matching_skill(pattern):
                gaps.append(SkillGap(
                    pattern=pattern,
                    suggested_name=self.generate_name(pattern),
                    confidence=pattern.frequency / 10,
                ))
        return gaps
```

#### User Notification

```
💡 Skill Gap Detected

You've performed this workflow 4 times this session:
  1. Read error log
  2. Search codebase for error string
  3. Find related test
  4. Run test in isolation

Would you like to create a "debugging-from-logs" skill? [y/n]
```

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Detects repeated command sequences
- [ ] Identifies manual workarounds
- [ ] Calculates confidence score
- [ ] Notifies user of detected gaps
- [ ] Integrates with skill creation flow

---

### T21.3: Auto-Skill Creation

**Priority:** P2
**Effort:** L (6 hrs)
**Type:** feature

#### Description

Generate skill drafts automatically from detected gaps, requiring only user approval and minor edits.

#### Generation Process

1. Analyze detected pattern
2. Extract key commands and decision points
3. Generate SKILL.md structure
4. Populate with observed steps
5. Add placeholders for user customization
6. Validate against skill spec

#### Generated Skill Example

```markdown
---
name: debugging-from-logs
description: Guides systematic debugging workflow starting from error logs.
  Covers log analysis, codebase search, test isolation, and fix verification.
---

# Debugging from Logs

## Trigger
Use when you see an error in logs and need to trace to root cause.

## Workflow

### 1. Analyze Error
Read the error log and identify:
- Error type/message
- Stack trace location
- Timestamp and context

### 2. Search Codebase
\`\`\`bash
grep -rn "error_string" src/
\`\`\`

### 3. Find Related Tests
[Auto-detected pattern: user usually runs related test]

### 4. Isolate and Fix
[Placeholder: Add your debugging approach]

---
*Auto-generated from session patterns. Please review and customize.*
```

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Generates valid SKILL.md from patterns
- [ ] Includes observed commands
- [ ] Marks placeholders for customization
- [ ] Passes skill validator
- [ ] `--auto-approve` flag for trusted generation

---

### T21.4: Skill Quality Scoring

**Priority:** P2
**Effort:** M (4 hrs)
**Type:** feature

#### Description

Score skills on multiple quality dimensions to identify improvement opportunities and rank for discovery.

| Completeness | 20% | Covers full workflow |
| Usage Frequency | 20% | How often invoked |
| User Satisfaction | 15% | Thumbs up/down on skill use |

#### CLI Output

```bash
$ bpsai-pair skill score

Skill Quality Report:

| Skill | Score | Token Eff | Triggers | Complete | Usage |
|-------|-------|-----------|----------|----------|-------|
| managing-task-lifecycle | 92 | 95 | 90 | 88 | 95 |

### T21.7: Preset-Specific CI Workflows

**Priority:** P3
**Effort:** M (3 hrs)
**Type:** feature
**Source:** MISSING-003

#### Description

Cookie cutter CI workflows are too generic (both Node and Python). Make them preset-specific.

#### Current Issue

```yaml
# Current ci.yml runs both:
- Python tests (even for React projects)
- Node tests (even for Python projects)
```

#### Solution

Generate CI based on preset:

| Preset | CI Workflow |
|--------|-------------|
| `react` | Node only (npm test, npm build) |
| `python` | Python only (pytest, mypy) |
| `fastapi` | Python only + API tests |
| `fullstack` | Both Node and Python |

#### Implementation

1. Create preset-specific workflow templates
2. Update cookie cutter to select based on preset
3. Add workflow template to presets.py

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] React preset generates Node-only CI
- [ ] Python presets generate Python-only CI
- [ ] Fullstack preset generates both
- [ ] Workflows validated
